## Features

### CV Sections

The information in the user's CV can be displayed in four types of sections.

-   **Info Section** would include the name and two tables of items for various contact information
    ![alt text](readme-files/info-section-example.png "Info Section")
-   **Listing Section** would be used for listings such as education or work experience
    ![alt text](readme-files/listing-section-example.png "Listing section")
-   **Block Section** would be used to display simple paragraphs of information
    ![alt text](readme-files/block-section-example.png "block Section")
-   **Three Column** would be used to list elements in three columns
    ![alt text](readme-files/three-col-section-example.png "Three Column Section")

Sections can be added or removed, and re-organized with drag and drop. This also applies to individual items within these sections.

### Themes

Additionally, the CV can be customized using 4 different themes that change the fonts and colors on the final product:

-   #### Default

![alt text](readme-files/theme-default-example.png "Default theme")

-   #### Modern

![alt text](readme-files/theme-modern-example.png "Modern theme")

-   #### Lavender

![alt text](readme-files/theme-lavender-example.png "Lavender theme")

-   #### Deco

![alt text](readme-files/theme-deco-example.png "Deco theme")

### Save Function

Any changes made to the CV or its theme can be saved to be updated at a later time.
When saved, the content of the page generates a JSON object which is stored in the browser's local storage. The theme chosen by the user is also saved to local storage.
Upon reload of the page, the saved data and theme are automatically displayed on the page. If no information is found in local storage, a default CV and theme will be displayed.

### Download as PDF

The CV builder uses html2pdf.js to convert the content of the CV into a PDF document, that can be downloaded to the user's device.

### Reset

A reset button at the bottom of the page enables the user to reset the CV's content and theme to their default values. I also clears the local storage. The user has to confirm the reset in a modal window before the content is reset.

### Responsive Design

This application is primarily meant to be used on computer sized screens but it has been optimized to work on mobile devices as well.
It was built responsively with the bootstrap framework, and uses JQuery UI Touch Punch to ensure all functionalities work on touch enabled devices.

## Technologies

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Bootstrap
-   Javascript
-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
-   [JQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/): for effects on the page and the sortable function
-   JQuery UI Touch Punch: to make JQuery UI's sortable function touch device friendly
-   [html2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js): relies on HTML2canvas and jsPDF to convert the CV to a PDF file
-   [anchorme.js](https://alexcorvi.github.io/anchorme.js/): dynamically finds urls and email addresses on the CV and converts them to anchor tags

---

## Tools

-   VSCode: IDE used to create and edit code
-   Adobe Photoshop: Image editor used for section vignettes and favicon
-   Balsamiq: Used to create wireframes
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): used for all icons throughout the site
-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): The following fonts were imported from Google fonts for the various themes: Montserrat, Open Sans, Raleway, Roboto, Lato, Jost
-   [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb): Chrome extension used to test site at different screen sizes
-   [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/): used to test site performance
-   [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/): used to validate HTML code
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): used to validate CSS

## Testing

### Manual Testing

The site was tested on various platforms and browsers to ensure proper display and functionality across different screen sizes, including touch devices.

As functionalities were added to the application, thorough testing was conducted to ensure proper behavior with no side-effects.

Google Chrome's dev tools were used extensively for debugging.

The HTML and CSS were validated on W3C Validators, and speed tested on Pingdom.

### User Testing

When the program was advanced enough to be usable, several users were asked to manipulate it to assess their experience and comfort with it. This highlighted the need for more consistent user feedback. The following changes came from this round of testing:

-   Header background color changes when theme changes
-   Placeholders on sortable items to notify user where the item will be positioned
-   Notification when content is saved to local storage, additionally a note was added to let users know the content would be lost if the browser's cache was cleared
-   Confirmation window when content is reset

### Known Bugs

-   When generated from a mobile device, the PDF has a different aspect than when generated from larger screen sized because of how html2pdf.js converts a page to a PDF file. By sending options to html2pdf.js, it is possible for the CV to be laid out as if on a larger screen size, however the page breaks on the PDF seem to be determined by the device's window height, resulting in uneven and unpredictable page breaks. For this reason, the choice was made to have the PDF appear differently when generated from different screen sizes, for now.

---

## Upcoming features

A number of new features will be implemented in the future.

-   A preview of the final PDF will be seen before download

-   More themes and granular customization options, such as a choice of fonts and colors.

-   New types of sections will be available for use

-   An interactive tutorial will be created to guide new users on how to use the platform

-   Currently, the fields that the user can edit are DIV elements with the attribute contenteditable set to "true". For the application to be more semantically accurate and accessible, these will be replaced with input fields.

## Code Notes

Initially when the CV was saved, the entire inner HTML of printable element was saved as a string. Measures were taken to instead translate the content of the html to an object, which allowed for more flexibility and scalability down the line.
